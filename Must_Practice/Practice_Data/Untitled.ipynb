    "Time series forecasting is a very important concept in statistics and machine learning. Predicting web traffic is a popular application of time series forecasting. It helps web servers to manage their resources better to avoid outages. To make the project even more interesting, you can use wavenets instead of traditional neural networks.\n",
    "Wavenets use causal convolutions which makes them more efficient and lightweight at the same time."
